Welcome to HAMP101's Documentation!
===============================================

.. note::
   Please consider that this project is under active development
   and our documentation is a work in progress.

   This documentation is built from the latest code in the main branch of the repository.
   It does not necessarily reflect a released version, and there may be short-commings when compared
   to the on-going code development. If you have queries related to
   this or if there is anything you wish to report please please :ref:`contact us! <contact>`.

This repository is for scientists using HAMP, to understand what it is and how to
post-process the raw IQ data.

To (locally) reproduce this project, simply clone the repository. You will need to setup an
environment with the dependencies installed and then run ``pre-commit install`` but other than
that everything should work out of the box and you can now run & have fun with the project...
If not, please raise an issue on the GitHub repository.

Time to get involved! Check out the :doc:`getting started page<usage/getstart>`.
