Commit Messages and Versioning
==============================

This repository uses cocogitto, a Command-Line Interface (like git) and a toolbox for the
Conventional Commits and Semver specifications. The basic idea is that by writing commit messages
which always obey the conventional commit message structure cocogitto can automatically
perform version bumping and generate a changelog for you.

The conventional commit message structure is:

  <type>[optional scope]: <description>

  [optional body]

  [optional footer(s)]

but you can find more information on the conventional commit website (see below).
